## Application Objective

Help runners perform various calculations to assist in their progress.

- Calculate a percentage of VMA and split times to prepare for training?
- Find what time to aim for in a half-marathon based on a 10km race time?

**RunningTools** is here!

## Technical Objective

Use the React framework in a highly optimized way. The application's goal is simplicity and fluidity.

The choice of React with Vite as Build Tool seemed interesting.
